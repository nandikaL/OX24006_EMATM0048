HELP!!

1. in payments: I hard coded the 6000 payment for tech bc it wont work, cant figure out why again. If warehouse works so should this?


ideas for extension: 
1. stock how much you want in the warehouse (but will this kill me? idk)
2. choice of warehouse expansion after 4 quarters, just increase the the max
3. technician:
when select technician, ask if specialize
